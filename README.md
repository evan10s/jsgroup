jsGroup
=======
jsGroup is grouping software allows you to take data that contains people's names, people with whom they would like to be in a group, and people with whom they don't want to be in a group and make groups bssed on the data.  The algorithm, which is currently in beta, will evaluate each person, in the order that they appear, and figure out who the best person with whom to group them.  It will take into consideration who the person wants and doesn't want.  If a person is okay with anyone being in their group, they will be saved until the end, at which point they will be group with the other people who are okay with anyone and also anyone whose preferences were met; jsGroup will indicate these people with an asterisk at the end of their name.  Note that asterisks will not be appended to the names of those people who were okay with anyone and were wanted by someone else.
